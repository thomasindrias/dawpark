## Requests

To get all the parkings that exist in the Trafikverket API simply run:

```http
GET /parkings
```

This returns data in the following format:

```JSON
[
    {
        county_no: string[] // County number (l√§nsnummer)
        deleted: boolean // Indicates that the data record has been deleted

        distance_to_nearest_city: string // General description of how close the parking is to the nearest city in swedish
        sweref: string // Parking position as a geometric point in the SWEREF99TM coordinate system
        wgs84: {type: string, coordinates: number[]} // Parking position as a geometric point. coordinates[0] = longitude, coordinates[1] = latitude.
        icon_id: string // Icon ID for the parking lot icon
        parking_id: string // The UNIQUE id for the parking lot
        location_description: string // General description of the location in swedish
        modified_time: Date // Time when the data record was changed
        name: string // The name of the parking lot
